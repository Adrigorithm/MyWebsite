## Credits
The following tools were used in the creation of this project (I am likely forgetting some):
- [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) for creating vector images for flowcharts
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) because vanilla CSS is mid
- [Mozilla documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) for the best web development documentation
- [CSS filter generator](https://angel-rs.github.io/css-color-filter-generator/) to generate filters to obtain a specific colour
